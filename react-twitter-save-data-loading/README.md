# Demo: React-twitter save-data resource loading in React

[React Tweet](https://github.com/mannynotfound/react-tweet) is an demo application looking like Twitter website.

This version of React twitter uses Save-Data Client Hint to determine whether to load low-fidelity or high-fidelity images based on the user's Save-Data option on Android Chrome (e.g Lite Mode On -> lo-fi, Lite Mode Off -> hi-fi).

[Live Demo](https://adaptive-loading.web.app/react-twitter-save-data-loading/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and Node.js/Express.js for server side.
