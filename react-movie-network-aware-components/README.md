# Demo: React-movie network-aware resource loading in React

Similar to before, this version will use the Network Information API to determine whether to load a low-fidelity or high-fidelity image based on movie posters.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/react-movie-network-aware-components
cd react-movie-network-aware-components
npm install
npm start
npm run build
```
