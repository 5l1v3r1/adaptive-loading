# Network-aware Components

Nothing to see here...yet.

## Background

Network-aware components use network signals to load the best version of a component or resource for the user's effective connection speed. 

Users on a slow (e.g 2G) connection may get a low-fi version while fast connections (e.g 4G) get a high-fi version.

This approach can enable a number of use-cases:

* Network-aware components
* Network-aware code-splitting
