# Network-aware Components

Nothing to see here...yet.

## Background

Network-aware components use network signals to load the best version of a component or resource for the user's effective connection speed. 

Users on a slow (e.g 2G) connection may get a low-fi version while fast connections (e.g 4G) get a high-fi version.

This approach can enable a number of use-cases:

* Network-aware components
* Network-aware code-splitting

## Examples

### Simple
* [Network-aware loading](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/cra-network-aware-component) with create-react-app
* [Network-aware code-splitting](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/cra-network-aware-code-splitting) with create-react-app

### Advanced
* [React Movie - network-aware components](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/react-movie-network-aware-components)
* [React Shrine - network-aware code-splitting](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/react-shrine-network-aware-code-splitting)
