# Environment-aware Components

An exploration into loading and rendering the most suitable version of a component based on signals exposed to the web (network, CPU, memory etc).

## Demos

### Simpler
* [Network-aware loading](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/cra-network-aware-component) with create-react-app
* [Network-aware code-splitting](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/cra-network-aware-code-splitting) with create-react-app
* [Network-aware data-fetching](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-network-aware-data-fetching) with create-react-app
* [Battery considerate loading](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-battery-considerate-loading) with create-react-app
* [Memory considerate loading](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-memory-considerate-loading) with create-react-app
* [UA-aware code-splitting](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-ua-aware-code-splitting) with create-react-app

### Advanced
* [React Movie - network-aware components](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/react-movie-network-aware-components)
* [React Shrine - network-aware code-splitting](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/react-shrine-network-aware-code-splitting)
